Use Github to pull and push code.

Each sorting algorithm will be written in 1 file cpp.
In each file sort.cpp:
    - Add #include "..\header.h"
    - In RUNTIME function, add code to calculate time.
    E.g. heapSort.cpp and insertionSort.cpp
    - Prototype:
        + abcSortRunTime(int *&arr, int n, int &time)
        + abcSortCompare(int *&arr, int n, int &count_comparisons)


Structure in Sources code folder:
    1. data folder: contains input file
    2. sorting-algorithm folder: contains 11 sort algorithm file.
    3. main.cpp: contains code to execute command lines.
    4. DataGenerator.cpp
    5. header.h: contains library used in project.
